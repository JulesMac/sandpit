# Sandpit

This repository is a simple sandbox for practicing git workflows and other development experiments. ðŸ˜Š

## Contents

- `test.txt` â€“ a file containing a short greeting used for demonstration purposes.
- `index.html` â€“ a static web page with a "Hello World" message.

## Usage

Feel free to modify files, create branches, and explore different git features. There is no production code hereâ€”it's all for learning and experimentation.

## Hosting the static page on GitHub Pages

1. Commit the `index.html` file to your repository (already included here).
2. Go to your repository's settings on GitHub and enable **GitHub Pages**.
3. Select the branch (e.g., `main`) and the root directory as the source.
4. GitHub will publish the page at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
5. Push any changes to update the published site automatically.
